---

For tonight's homework, please do the following:

 1. Install git and set up your GitHub ssh key - could the first person to finish this on Mac and Windows please email a "howto" to the mailing list.
 1. Go to [https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions](https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/submissions) and clone the repository (using the ssh link).
 2. Go into it and make a folder using the naming convension last_first under the appropriate directory (6 or 7) - my directory would be zamansky_michael
 3. Add a python program there that illustrates where you are right now (if it's multiple files, put it in a directory within your named directory).
 4. You probably also want to clone the classcode and actual web site repositories.

**Note:** You might have to **git pull** before you **git push** if other people are working at the same time. If git gives you an error, read it carefully, it will usually tell you what to do.
